/*
 * 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform mathematical operations.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	a + b
-	Subtraction	a - b
*	Multiplication	a * b
/	Division (returns quotient)	a / b
%	Modulus (remainder)	a % b
2. Relational Operators
Used to compare two values.

Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to	a == b
!=	Not equal to	a != b
>	Greater than	a > b
<	Less than	a < b
>=	Greater than or equal to	a >= b
<=	Less than or equal to	a <= b
3. Logical Operators
Used to perform logical operations (commonly used with boolean values).

Operator	Description	Example
&&	Logical AND	a && b
`		`
!	Logical NOT	!a
4. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	Example
=	Simple assignment	a = b
+=	Add and assign	a += b (same as a = a + b)
-=	Subtract and assign	a -= b (same as a = a - b)
*=	Multiply and assign	a *= b (same as a = a * b)
/=	Divide and assign	a /= b (same as a = a / b)
%=	Modulus and assign	a %= b (same as a = a % b)
5. Unary Operators
Used to operate on a single operand.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Unary plus (indicates positive value)	+a
-	Unary minus (negates value)	-a
++	Increment (increases value by 1)	a++ or ++a
--	Decrement (decreases value by 1)	a-- or --a
!	Logical NOT (inverts boolean value)	!a
6. Ternary Operator
A shorthand for if-else conditions.

Operator	Description	Example
? :	Ternary conditional (if-else)	condition ? expr1 : expr2
Example:

java
Copy code
int max = (a > b) ? a : b;
This assigns max the value of a if a > b, otherwise assigns it b.

7. Bitwise Operators
Used to perform bit-level operations.

Operator	Description	Example
&	Bitwise AND	a & b
`	`	Bitwise OR
^	Bitwise XOR	a ^ b
~	Bitwise NOT	~a
<<	Left shift	a << 2
>>	Right shift	a >> 2
>>>	Unsigned right shift	a >>> 2
8. Shift Operators
Used to shift bits to the left or right.

Operator	Description	Example
<<	Left shift	a << 1
>>	Right shift	a >> 1
>>>	Unsigned right shift	a >>> 1
9. Instanceof Operator
Used to test whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements an interface.

Operator	Description	Example
instanceof	Tests if an object is an instance of a class or interface	obj instanceof MyClass
